### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


**wessvs/wessvs** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on start my portfolio and start my carreer as a dev. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript for Front-End and Python Flask. 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: text me out on Linkedin.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm too a musician, and someday I want to mix my dev skills to create some music app or site.
